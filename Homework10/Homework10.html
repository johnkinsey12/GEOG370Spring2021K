<h1>Homework 8: Census data choropleth Ratio Data </h1>
<h3>These maps show the population of Florida enrolled in school from Kindergarten to 12th grade over the entire Floridian population enrolled in school ages 3+. This data was downloaded from the census.gov website. By cleaning the data from the excel sheet from the census website to show population enrollment and those enrolled from K-12, I was able to classify the data in three different ways through performing a join. </h3>
