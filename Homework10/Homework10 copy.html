<h1>Homework 10: Vector Spatial Analysis </h1>
<h3>What area of Rockfish Creek Watershed is also occupied by Fort Bragg Military Base? Due to the fact that parts of Fort Bragg is situated on a natural reserve between rivers, it is crucial to understand how this particular watershed impacts the reserve and physical geography of the military institution. Geoprocessing tools to make this map include using the "dissolve", "intersect", and "clip" functions. From the results, we can see that the northern parts of the watershed are located within the natural reserves of Fort Bragg.</h3>
